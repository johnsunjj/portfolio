	<h2>Official Coronation portraits show Charles is 'a King who knows his own mind' who has surrounded himself with a slimmed down monarchy of people he can depend on... and sister Anne being at his right hand is 'no accident', royal expert reveals</h2>
	<img src="images/01.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
	<p>King Charles III's (right; centre-left of left photo) first official portrait following the Coronation show him as a 'monarch who knows his own mind', surrounded by 'the people the people he can depend on', a royal expert has said. This came as the first official portraits of the event were released, unveiling the King's new 'slimmed down' monarchy, with Princess Anne (to the left of the King in left photo) and Queen Camilla (inset; centre-right of left) by his side. Royal expert Richard Fitzwilliams told MailOnline said of the King's solo portrait: 'This one is a strong forceful portrait of a monarch who knows his own mind and is very experienced.' Mr Fitzwilliam said that Princess Anne's proximity to the King in the group portrait 'is no accident', adding that the fact she is 'experienced and hard-working' will have been noticed by Charles. He added that Queen Camilla looked 'more relaxed and comfortable' wearing the crown in her solo portrait than she did in Westminster Abbey. </p>

A post-mortem examination found the 22-month-old had Covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common bug which usually causes mild cold-like symptoms. Mr and Mrs Findlay, of Inverurie, Aberdeenshire, confirmed Dylan had been refused a preventative treatment for RSV by doctors.

	      <img src="images/37.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive">
	     <p>The Cannes red carpet returned as the 76th Film Festival got underway on Tuesday evening with the premiere of Louis XV period drama Jeanne du Barry - but for those gathered on the famous Croisette this balmy evening on the French Riviera the only plot was one of redemption. Indeed, there were ripples of applause underscoring the universally raucous cheers of support that greeted the almost-cancelled Johnny Depp as he made his first appearance at the annual ceremony, and more pertinently, his first since winning his highly publicised libel trial against his ex-wife Amber Heard. It was the sweetest vindication for the actor, 59, who takes on the role of Louis XV, couldn't hide his delight about being back in the Hollywood fold, after previously being dropped from several projects during the trial, including the Fantastic Beasts film franchise. Also on the red carper was Uma Thurman (bottom centre) and Elle Fanning (bottom right).</p>

It was the sweetest vindication for the actor, 59, who takes on the role of Louis XV, couldn't hide his delight about being back in the Hollywood fold, after previously being dropped from several projects during the trial, including the Fantastic Beasts film franchise.
